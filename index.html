    <h3>Traveling</h3>
    <p><img src="images/imagecopy.png">I am someone who loves to travel and explore the world. I have been to North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. This includes 12 US states and 10 countries. Some of my favorite vacations include ones to Italy, Switzerland, and Hawaii. I also enjoy exploring the unique cuisines of the places I visit such as the cheese fondue I tried in Switzerland and the Gelato I had in Italy. Furthermore, I am eager to learn more about the history of the places I visit and I definitely learned a lot through my to Egypt where I observed ancient <a href= "https://www.britannica.com/topic/hieroglyph" target="_blank">hieroglyphics</a> and mesmerizing monuments. Overall, I enjoy traveling and learning about new places and cultures.</p>

<h3>Favorite Animal</h3>
<p id="p2"><img src="images/image.png" id="dolphin">My favorite animal is a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/dolphin-mammal" target="_blank">dolphin</a> due to their playful nature and their witty behavior. There are 49 dolphin species yet my favorite is the Orca. I can remember going whale watching and being surrounded by a pod of over 100 dolphins as they swam around our boat and this experience was mesmerizing. <span class="highlight"> I also enjoy the dolphins show at Sea World as one can see how smart these dolphins truly are.</span>Found in almost all parts of the world, these marine mammals definitely attract a lot of attention wherever they are!</p>

<h3>Favorite Season</h3>
<p id="p3"><img src="images/imagecopy2.png" id="pumpkin">My favorite time of the year is the fall, usually from October to December. To begin, I enjoy seeing the deciduous trees with their red and orange leaves. Furthermore, I enjoy the pumpkin spice flavor in many dishes and drinks, especially pumpkin pie <a href="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/pumpkin-pie-with-caramel-pecan-topping/" target="_blank">pumpkin pie</a>. Additionally, fall features many holidays including Halloween and Thanksgiving Break. Moreover, I enjoy warm drinks like hot chocolate which you can find almost everywhere during the fall. Therefore, in my opinion, fall is the best season of the year.</p>
